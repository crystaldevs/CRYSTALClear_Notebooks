# CRYSTALClear_Notebooks

This repository contains a curated collection of **Jupyter notebooks** showcasing usage examples and practical workflows based on the [`CRYSTALClear`](https://crystaldevs.github.io/CRYSTALClear/) package.

The notebooks are designed to demonstrate the core functionalities of `CRYSTALClear`, providing hands-on examples for:

- I/O for the `CRYSTAL` code
- Data analysis and post-processing
- Advanced plotting tools (e.g. electron and phonon bands, IR and Raman spectra, elastic properties, ...)

## ðŸ”— Usage

These notebooks are intended to be used as companion examples for the official `CRYSTALClear` [documentation](https://crystaldevs.github.io/CRYSTALClear/). You can view the rendered notebooks directly through the documentation site or clone this repository for local execution:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/crystaldevs/CRYSTALClear_Notebooks.git
cd CRYSTALClear_Notebooks
```

You may need to install the `CRYSTALClear` package and related dependencies to run the notebooks:

pip install CRYSTALClear
```
